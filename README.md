# VagranTRT -- A Vagrant setup for the WordPress.org Theme Review Team 

## Overview

I started this project in order to allow the WordPress.org Theme Review Team (TRT) to better standardize on a reviewing environment. VagranTRT should give a unified platform for TRT members using Vagrant and should (hopefully) lead to faster theme review turn-around times.

## Vagrant Primer

The [Vagrant CLI documentation](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/cli/index.html) will be useful for developers that haven't used Vagrant before.

Some useful commands:

* `vagrant up` - Start and provisions the VM
* `vagrant halt` - Stops the VM
* `vagrant reload` - Restarts and provisions the VM
* `vagrant provision` - Provisions the VM
* `vagrant ssh` - Logs into the VM with ssh
* `vagrant destroy` - Deletes the VM

## Submodules

The puppet modules are all set up as submodules in `puppet/modules`. In general, you shouldn't have to worry about this because the `vip-init` script will update the submodules automatically. Just noting here for documentation purposes at this point.

## Acknowledgements

I have stood upon the shoulders of giants -- much of the inspiration and format of this project is based upon the hard work those contributing to the [VIP Quickstart](https://github.com/Automattic/vip-quickstart) project have put in and I thank them greatly for that work.
